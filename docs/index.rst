Overview
=============================
Consecution is:
  * An easy-to-use pipeline abstraction inspired by
    `Apache Storm Topologies <http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Tutorial.html>`_.
  * Designed to simplify building ETL pipelines that are robust and easy to test
  * A system for wiring together simple processing nodes to form a DAG, which is fed with a python iterable
  * Built using synchronous, single-threaded execution strategies designed to run efficiently on a single core
  * Implemented in pure-python with optional requirements that are needed only for graph visualization
  * Written with 100% test coverage
