Introduction
---
I really like the way django storm processes data streams, but I'm too
lazy to set up, configure, and maintain the jvm on my machine.

This package (which has yet to be written) will implement a python-based
stream processing library with no external dependencies.


Current Stage of Developement
----
I am still in the very early stages of figuring out how to set everything
up.  I pushed this featureless package to pypi just to reserve the name.
